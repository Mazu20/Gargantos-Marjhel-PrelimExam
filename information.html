    <h2 style=font-family:"Roboto Mono"><font color=#505950>About Me</font></h2>
    <p style=font-family:"Roboto Mono"><font color=#6C706B>My name is Marjhel M. Gargantos, pen name is Mazu. I'm 20 years old and lived in Caloocan City. I am an animation student from Manila Central University and before that I studied architecture at the University of the East. Shifting from architecture to animation has been a big change in my journey, but it reflects how much I truly value creativity, storytelling, and art. My background in architecture gave me a foundation in design and structure, while animation allows me to breathe life into stories and characters that people can connect with.<br><br>
Through freelancing and comic making, I have already gained hands-on experience and have even handled difficult clients along the way. Some of those situations tested my patience and even left me with a few traumatic experiences, but I do not see those as reasons to stop. Instead, I view them as lessons that continue to shape me, teaching me how to stay professional, resilient, and open-minded no matter what I face. My past may be filled with challenges, but none of them will ever hinder my growth. In fact, they serve as reminders of how far I have come and how much further I can still go.<br><br>
As for what I like, I truly enjoy creating and exploring different approaches to art, trying out new ways of storytelling, and sharing my works on different platforms where people can see and connect with them. I also value feedback because I know it helps me grow both as an artist and as a person in real life. I take it as an opportunity to reflect, improve, and see things from another perspective. On the other hand, what I dislike the most is dealing with people who have a very high and egoistic personality, the type who refuses to accept any feedback at all. For me, growth will always come from humility, honesty, and the willingness to listen. No one becomes better by shutting themselves off, and I believe being open-minded is one of the most important things in any creative journey.</p>
